# Bike-Sharing System Simulation Project

## Project Members
- CHU Xuan Thang
- NGUYEN Tuong Quang

## Project Objective
Develop a bike-sharing service simulation system, similar to Velib or V'Lille, with the following characteristics:
- Users can rent and return bikes at stations
- Each station has a limited capacity (10-20 bikes)
- Supports regular and electric bikes
- Supports accessories (baskets, luggage racks)

## Project Progress

### September: Design Phase
- Analyzing system goals and logic
- Identifying core components:
  1. User
  2. Bike
  3. Station
  4. Control Center
- Methodology: Team discussions, collaborative problem-solving

### October: Core Class Implementation
- Programming main classes
- Integrating design patterns
- Challenges:
  - Synchronizing interactions between classes
  - Developing bike rental system logic
- Outcomes:
  - Deeper understanding of object-oriented design
  - Improved programming practices

### November: Design Pattern Expansion
- Added design patterns:
  - Decorator
  - Singleton
  - Redistribution
- Introduced new classes:
  - Worker
  - Visitor
  - Mechanic
- Challenges:
  - Integrating design patterns
  - Defining responsibilities of new classes

### December: Project Refinement
- System integration
- Comprehensive testing
- Resolving final issues:
  - Bike distribution logic
  - Control Center synchronization
  - Optimizing Decorator interactions

## Key Learnings
- Importance of incremental development
- Value of design pattern flexibility
- Collaborative problem-solving

This report summarizes the project development process, from initial design to the completion of the bike-sharing service simulation system.
